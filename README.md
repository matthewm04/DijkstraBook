A sort of visualizer of social media platforms like Facebook

If you want to run this application, build it in Visual Studio and be sure to include the .csv in the same folder.

Really, you could build and run it with anything as long as you include the .csv
Or, you could make your own .csv with your own names and weights if you want.

This was a project I made for a data structures class at school

I made it because my professor told me to and I had to understand maps and Dijkstras algorithm

What is does is it reads and parses the .csv file, putting all the names and the weights of each persons relationship with each other into a map. It will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best way to get from one person to another via friends.
So, it goes through the degrees of separation from one person to another, if they are related at all.
And it does so with the algorithm finding the shortest path in the map.

This project really taught me about how maps work, Dijkstra's algorithm, and also parsing .csv files.

Thanks for taking the time to go through my project!
